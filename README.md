Implement a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in
components that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the
input field. (eg: you can use a bigger font size for a planet with larger population,
or even show a bigger container size for a planet with larger population - we
would like to see your creativity). On clicking the item from the results of the
type-along search, it should display the corresponding planet information.
You also need to provide the relevant Logout flow properly in your application.
Advanced :
• Only the user Luke Skywalker should be able to make more than 15 searches
in a minute.
